  "description": "Dipòsit Digital de Documents (DDD) is the project to handle all digital content at UAB libraries in a single platform, so it can be found with a single search, but structured in smaller collections. Growth is constant, but basically we have five types of collections: UAB digital publications, bibliographic databases, personal archives, course materials, and digitised material, either in-house or commercial.",
